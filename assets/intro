Under mysterious circumstances you have been falsely convicted of treason.
You have been exiled from your homeland, the Kingdom of Panavera.

You are cast into the wilderness, in which you face many a great peril, struggling as you can to survive.

You must make your way back to civilization and clear your name.

To do so,
will you wield the pen or the sword?
Will you join the forces of good or evil?
Will you seek revenge or justice?

Your fate lies in your hands alone...

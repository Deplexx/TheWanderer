You hardly stir as the rear gate smacks the backside of the wain, your eyes downcast in somber melancholy.
An immense load hoists itself into the cart. You feel a mammoth pair of gauntlets seize your upper arms.
You follow their lead out of the rear of the wagon.

"To the kiln, posthaste. We must complete the ritual before nightfall."

"Aye."

You are led uphill and set down on your knees before a faint heat. A kilnfire was started before you arrived.
You feel a slight tremor as the same immensity slumps down perhaps a meter or so from where you are set.

You hear metal being drawn against kilncoals.

"Plow it all!"

The dropped metal rings out as it racks the kiln.

"Wassa' matta'?"

Some tentative bootfalls are made toward the kiln in the immensity's vicinity.

"Keep your bleeding eyes on the traitor, you bafoon!"

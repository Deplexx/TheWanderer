Your heel strikes dead air. A pair of hands seizes your leg and jerks you from the the wagon.
You flail your arms, desperately searching for something to grasp.

You fall several feet, slamming down onto the soil below. You gasp for breath as you feel a boot heel drive into your midsection.
One of the men climbs atop you and holds down your arms down. You struggle, but cannot overcome him. The other man bounds your feet together.

You feel your legs being lifted. You are being dragged uphill. You know where you will go.
You feel your legs thrown down. A foot stomps down into your back. You feel a faint heat.

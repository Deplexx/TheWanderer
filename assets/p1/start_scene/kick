Your heel strikes dead air. A pair of hands seizes your leg and jerks you from the the wagon.
You flail your arms, desperately searching for something to grasp.

You fall several feet, slumping down onto the soil below. You gasp for breath as you feel a boot heel drive into your midsection.
One of the men climbs atop you and holds down your arms down. You struggle, but cannot overcome him. The other man binds your feet.

You feel your legs being lifted. You are being dragged uphill. You know where you will go.

Your legs are cast down. A foot stomps down between your shoulder blades. You feel a faint heat.
You hear metal being drawn against the coals of the kilnfire. You begin to tremble.

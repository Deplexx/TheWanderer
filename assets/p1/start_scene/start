You come to, dazed. Your vision is obscured by a burlap sack drawn over your 1head,
but you quickly realize that you are in a horse-drawn wain. To where, you know not.

You are sore all over. You feel splotches of dried blood on your tattered garb.

Somebody speaks from the front of the wain.

"'Awd to believe a cobbla', of a' peopo', wos found guio'ty o' such a croime."

"Traitors come in all forms these days."

"S'pose ya roight... You ge' a gewd look at our man, err 'e wos beaten, shackled, and defaced?"

"No."

"Jus' as gewd. Basterd ne'er belonged in da souf."

"Silence."

...

Minutes pass. The wain comes to a gradual halt. The horses stir and whinny.
You hear the two coach people disembark.
They exchange a few words in the old tongue, but alas, you speak it not.

You hear bootfalls.
You hear the rear of the wagon come unlatched.

1 Kick outward toward the voices.
2 Jump out of the wagon, and attempt to escape.
3 Wait.

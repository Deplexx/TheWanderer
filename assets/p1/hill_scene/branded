You hear a metal object being drawn from above.
The sentinel pulls the collar of your tunic aloft.
You hear the fibers of the fabric split as the dagger is drawn from the collar down to the waist.

You hear approaching footfalls from the kiln.

You clench your eyes shut and your teeth together.

Without warning, a seering pain shoots through your back as the brand is pressed vigorously betwixt your shoulder blades.
You can do nothing but cry a blood-curdling howl in visceral agony.

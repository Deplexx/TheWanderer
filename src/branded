You hear a metal being drawn from above.
The sentinel pulls the collar of your tunic aloft.
You hear the fibers of the fabric split as the dagger is drawn from the collar down to the waist.

You hear approaching footfalls from the kiln.

You clench your eyes shut and your teeth together.

Without warning, a seering pain shoots through your backside as the brand is pressed vigorously betwixt the blades of your shoulders.
You can do nothing but cry a blood-curdling howl in visceral agony.

You inhale some quivering breaths. Something is tossed aground beside you.
You hear the two sentinels saunter off the hillcrest back toward the wain.
The shift your eyes downward toward the road. The wagon fades into a singularity in the distance.
You rotate your head, still trembling all over.

A grease-laden parcel wrapped in waxed paper rests beside your head, smelling of some stale convection.
After some time, you regain your faculties, slowly rising from the dust of the bare hilltop,
the biforcated tunic gliding down your arms as you rise.

You snatch up the tunic and wrap it around yourself from shoulder to waist, fashioning it into a makeshift rucksack.
You stow away the parcel.

Received canvas sack.

Received stale bread.

You descend the hill, staggering, and continue into the wood to the west...

As the rear of the cart swings open, you spring up from your seat and vault over the side.
Before your feet hit the ground beneath, you feel a sudden resistance seize your ankle.
Your body lurches back toward the wagon and you come crashing down on the side of it, dangling from ankle,
limp as a wrung-out dish cloth, groaning in agony.

You hear the two men calmly approach, one of them chortling between breaths.

"we'w, di'in't make it fah didja, chum?"

The burlap sack slips off your inverted head.
An upside-down, stocky-looking fellow clad in a mail jack and coif appears before you.
You shift your eyes to the right, and a woman comes into view. She is standing beside the cart, arms crossed in vexation.
She is clad in a plate cuirass with an etching on its surface, of what you cannot tell as her arms obscure the image.

"You've had your amusement, now unshackle the bleeding traitor. We must complete the ritual before nightfall..."

"Heh heh, aye!"

The stocky man at arms approaches, producing a tiny key, still bellowing wheezy laughter. He turns the key and you land head first
onto the dry soil below. He seizes you by shackles that restrain your wrists.

You look up and see a hill, with what appears to be a small kiln rendered from cobblestone atop.
You know this place. It is where all traitors go.
